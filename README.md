# Welcome to Audrey Tang's Data Science Portfolio

## [1. Skincare Product Prediction: End-to-End ML Project ](https://github.com/AudreyCLT/Sephora-ML-Project)
### Problem Statement:
How does the popularity of a skincare product change with the product's information (skin concern, skin type, price, etc)?

We will use Sephora's number of loves to quantify popularity, and will address this problem statement with regression models using supervised learning. The goal is to find out the features that makes a product popular from building models that can predict a product's popularity.

### Use Case for Business:
For skincare manufacturers, understanding what makes a product popular is important, as they can use their resources to produce products which will be popular. It also help with their pricing strategy. For example, are products made for dry skin more popular than those for oily skin? Or are moisturisers more well-loved than treatments?

For consumers, we can build interactive visualization tools from the a large dataset containing all products, which can help consumers with comparing the reviews of different products.

## [2. Credit Fraud Classification Project](https://github.com/AudreyCLT/Credit-Fraud-Classification)
### Problem Statement:
No one is impervious to financial crimes, and one of the most common one is having a malicious third-party using your credit card without your consent.  This leads to one of the most popular classification problems for data science, where we apply data science to check the validity of a credit card transaction.

### Packages:
- Spark's MLlib


## [3. Movie Review Topic Modelling + Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/AudreyCTang/Movie-Review-Topic-Modelling-Sentiment-Analysis)
### Problem Statement:
Using the IMDb review dataset, this machine learning model clusters the reviews into topics with LDA, and conduct sentiment analysis.

### Use Case for Business:
With the combination of topic modelling and sentiment analysis, movie production companies and streaming sites can group reviews by semantic similarity and obtain snapshot view of the sentiment.
